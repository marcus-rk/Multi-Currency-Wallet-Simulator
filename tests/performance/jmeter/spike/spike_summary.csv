Results indicate EXCHANGE is the slowest step in the spike scenario (highest average and highest tail latency at 90/95/99%), so end-to-end latency under load is primarily driven by the exchange operation rather than create/deposit/transactions. This is not critical here because Error% is 0%, but it identifies the main performance hotspot.
